<p>WebPd is a 100% JavaScript Pure Data runtime using Web Audio API to play audio in the browser. It aims at allowing a
    subset of Pure Data programming language to run in the browser without plugins and with best possible performance.

<p>Because we are working locally on our computer, we now need to run a local HTTP web server to be able to open the web
    page
    index.html properly. You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html"
        target="_blank">Python</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server" target="_blank">JS</a>
    frameworks for that purpose.

<p>HTML fundamentals:</p>

<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</p>

<p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</p>

<p>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</p>

<p>HTML consists of a series of elements</p>

<p>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</p>

<p>HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>

<p>Also,</p>

<p>The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document</p>

<p>The &lt;html&gt; element is the root element of an HTML page</p>

<p>The &lt;head&gt; element contains meta information about the HTML page</p>

<p>The &lt;title&gt; element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the
    page's tab)</p>

<p>The &lt;body&gt; element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as
    headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</p>

<p>The &lt;h1&gt; element defines a large heading</p>

<p>The &lt;p&gt; element defines a paragraph</p>

<p>WebPd uses jQuery:</p>

<p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and
    manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude
    of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people
    write JavaScript.</p>
