However, data must be sent from the smartphone to Python, which performs some basic processing (can be as simple as an addition and/or multiplication), then Python sends the data to Pure Data, which generates the sound. Alternatively you can opt for a non-realtime application (i.e. generation of  a wave file from Pure Data).\n",

Ensure (and monitor) that each system can keep up with the rate at which messages are received (i.e. complete the required processing before the next message is received). The rate at which messages are received and passed through the chain depends on the rate at which OSC messages are produced in the smartphone application. You can easily do that using the [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) package in Python as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7370801/how-do-i-measure-elapsed-time-in-python). Try to change the OSC message rate in the smartphone application and see if the system can still cope with that (by looking at the overall application behavior as well as at the time measurements).\n"

    "If you are interested in doing the opposite, i.e. run Python within Pure Data, you can try using this [package](https://grrrr.org/research/software/py/) and/or simply executing command line instructions from Pure Data. Since Pure Data has strict real-time computation constraints (it has to generate audio samples as a metronome to fill up the output buffer of thesoundcard in a timely manner), it is not a great idea to integrate into it Python computation which may break/compromize such constraints. Calling Python routines from Pure Data in a non-blocking and non-synchronous manner by using communication protocol such as OSC is probably the best solution."
